# Bulgarian-Phonetic-Dvorak

After switching to Dvorak, one of the hardest and most inconvenient things to do
was to type using the ‘Bulgarian - Phonetic’ keyboard layout.
‘Bulgarian - Phonetic’ is tied to the QWERTY layout,
and is made so that each sound of the Latin alphabet would be matched
to the letter in the Cyrillic alphabet, which carries the same sound.
It is a very convenient layout for the QWERTY typists,
so I tried carrying over the concept and translating the Dvorak layout
into a ‘Bulgarian - Phonetic - Dvorak’ layout.

Here are all the new mappings:

![Uppercase Layout](https://github.com/house-owl/Bulgarian-Phonetic-Dvorak/raw/master/layout_images/uppercase-layout.png)
![Caplock Layout](https://github.com/house-owl/Bulgarian-Phonetic-Dvorak/raw/master/layout_images/caplock-layout.png)

To install on a mac:

    git clone https://github.com/house-owl/Bulgarian-Phonetic-Dvorak.git
    sudo cp Bulgarian-Phonetic-Dvorak/layout/* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

This layout was created using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).
